# The lair of the Goblin Hoard

##
You enter the Goblin Dungeon. You notice you’re in a strange, dome shaped room. You see a message scratched the on the wall.

‘The goblin king awaits. Enter only the brave...’

There are two tunnels. You hear strange noises echoing from the right tunnel. You hear a persistent ‘drip drip’ coming from the left tunnel.
### Take the left tunnel.
#### The Mess Hall Cave
### Take the right tunnel.
#### The Fountain Room



#The Mess Hall Cave 

##
You step into the mess hall. There are 4 rows of very long tables. Each table is lined with juicy meats and hardly and veggies. On the third table, a short and stout goblin leans against his stone plate, drooling a bit. He is no doubt sleeping. Next to his plate is a fallen over goblet, with red wine dripping out onto the floor. There is another tunnel on the far end of the room. 
###Carefully move to the far tunnel.

#The Fountain Room.

##
Inside this room is long, square lake. It seems to be man made. You see chests at each corner of the room. Each one has the same keyhole. There are three tunnels leading out of the room. The first tunnel is the one you just came from. There is a big door blocking the second tunnel. From it you here voices you don’t understand. From the third tunnel you see and hear nothing but and empty void. The door from the second tunnel opens, and a small runt of a goblin waddles out. He begins to head out through the first tunnel. But he turns around and notices you! 



#Bed Hall 

##
You’re in a long corridor with fancy doors on either side.
There are labels on each door. 
‘King’s room’, ‘Jester’s room’, ‘Amal’s room’, ‘the dark room’? You here talking coming from Amal’s room and scary noises from the dark room.
There are many other rooms, too but they are not labeled and seem to be less important.
###Go to the King’s room.

### Go to Jester’s room.
#### Jesters’s room


#King’s room

##
You walk in only to fight find a big, gorgeous bedroom with paintings, two beds, and a big chest in the middle. The beds are about 13’ long and 9’ wide each. There is a crudely made crib in the room, and in it is a sleeping goblin child. A cabinet is wide open, and in it are clothes on that could fit a giant!
### Search the room.
#### King’s room search
### Leave to be on the safe side.

#Jester’s room

##
You open the door and walk into a dark room. You light a torch, and the room gets illuminated like a sky by the sun. There is a twin bed at the right side of the room, and a chest in the middle.

###If you have a ‘special key’, don’t read the rest of the passage, instead, Go to:
####Jester’s chest.


#Jester’s chest

## 
You put the key in the chest and turn it. The chest clicks open and inside you find a stuffed bear, but inside the bear is a... banana? But you peel open the banana and find a magic dagger with a emerald on it. But inside the dagger you find a regular dagger? Wait that didn’t happen. 
[ You obtained the Magic dagger. It adds one to your damage!]. 

#### Go back to: Jester’s room, and finish reading the passage.
