# The lair of the Goblin Hoard

##
You enter the Goblin Dungeon. You notice you’re in a strange, dome shaped room. You see a message scratched the on the wall.

‘The goblin king awaits. Enter only the brave...’

There are two tunnels. You hear strange noises echoing from the right tunnel. You hear a persistent ‘drip drip’ coming from the left tunnel.
### Take the left tunnel.
#### The Mess Hall Cave
### Take the right tunnel.
#### The Fountain Room



#The Mess Hall Cave 

##
You step into the mess hall. There are 4 rows of very long tables. Each table is lined with juicy meats and hardly any veggies. On the third table, a short and stout goblin leans against his stone plate, drooling a bit. He is no doubt sleeping. Next to his plate is a fallen over goblet, with red wine dripping out onto the floor. There is another tunnel on the far end of the room. 




#The Fountain Room

##
Inside this room is long, square lake. It seems to be man made. You see chests at each corner of the room. Each one has the same keyhole. There are three tunnels leading out of the room. The first tunnel is the one you just came from. There is a big door blocking the second tunnel. From it you here voices you don’t understand. From the third tunnel you see and hear nothing but and empty void. The door from the second tunnel opens, and a small runt of a goblin waddles out. He begins to head out through the first tunnel. But he turns around and notices you!
